// redux is predictable state container for js apps
/*
it is for js apps
redux is not tied to react
can be used with react , angular , vue or even vanila js
redux is library for js apps
it is state container
redux stores the state of your application
consider a react-app - state of a component
redux will store and manage the application state
it is predictable
redux is state container 
in redux ,a pattern is enforced to ensure all state transitions are explicit and can be tracked

-- redux is a predictable state container for js apps
why redux 
if you want to manage the global state of your application in apredictable way redux can help 

the patterns and tools provided by redux make it easier to understand when where why and how the state in your application is being updated and how your applicationlogic will behave those changes occur

what is redux toolkit
redux toolkit is the official , opinionated , batteries-included toolset for efficient redux development
it is also intended to be standard way to write redux logic in your application
why ?
congiguring redux is complicated
redux require too much boilerplate
more other packages needs to be installed

redux tookit featuring react
rtk+react
react is a library to build user interfaces 
redux is a library for managing state in a predicatble way in js application
redux toolkit is a libarary for efficient redux development

react-redux is a library that provides binding to use react and redux toolkit
together in an application
react-redux


actions 
synchronous actions 
as soon as an action was dispatched , the state was immediately updated
if u dispatch the CAKE_ORDERED action , the numOfCakes was right away decremented by 1
same with ICECREAM_ORDERED action as well


async actions
asunchronous API calls to fetch data from end point and use that data in our application
